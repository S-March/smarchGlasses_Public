# smarchGlasses_Public

At the end of the summer I was walking around town soaking in the sun while trying to avoid people (because, well, pandemic). 

As I typed in my next destination to my phone and started following the map, I realized I wasn't really enjoying the sights or the world around me. I was hyper focused on my phone screen and watching myself on the map, making sure I didn't miss a turn. 

While staring at the little blue dot, Ferris Bueller, in all his infinite wisdom spoke up in my head.

"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."

It was at that moment, I decided that I wanted to make some smart sunglasses that gave me turn-by-turn directions!
